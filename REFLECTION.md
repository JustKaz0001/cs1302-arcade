## Deadline 1 - TUE 2020-12-01 (Dec 01)

1. No work has been done on the project directly except looking up the games and how to potentially do them.
2. Before the next deadline i plan to decide what game to do and start some of the methods.
3. I plan on making branches for the visual aspects of the game and the backend code seperately and maybe one for updates on files too.
